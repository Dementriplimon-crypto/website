  Release notes for Ghostty 1.2.1, released on October 6, 2025.
---

Ghostty 1.2.1 features **two weeks of work** with changes from
**13 contributors** over **62 commits.** This is a patch release primarily
focused on fixing issues introduced in the 1.2.0 release. It includes
a small handful of improvements, too.

## Highlights

### Font Rendering Improvements

PRs: GH-8563 GH-8580 GH-8738 GH-8720 GH-8847

Ghostty 1.2.0 contained a substantial overhaul of the font rendering
system. As expected with such a large change, some issues were discovered
outside of our testing. Ghostty 1.2.1 addresses many of these issues.

An overview of the changes:

- Nerd Font icons are now larger and better matched in size relative to each
  other, making better use of available cell space. Icons wider than a single
  cell are now left-aligned rather than centered across cells.
- CJK characters no longer appear oversized when using wide-aspect primary fonts.
  The IC width (ideographic character width) is now upper-bounded by measuring
  the overall bounding box of ASCII characters.
- Glyph constraints are now applied before thickening and centering operations,
  ensuring that icon sizes and positions are consistent regardless of font size,
  thickening strength, or display DPI.
- Fixed bugs in Nerd Font patch extraction where rules were applied to wrong
  glyphs due to codepoint offset issues, and irrelevant patch sets were
  incorrectly included.
- Improved FreeType glyph measurements to ensure glyphs are measured with the
  same hinting as they are rendered.

### Shell Integration Adds `ghostty` to `PATH`

PR: GH-8976

Shell integration now automatically adds `GHOSTTY_BIN_DIR` to your PATH,
making the `ghostty` binary available in many shells without additional
configuration.

Ghostty previously (and still) adds `ghostty` to your PATH prior to executing
the shell, but many shell configurations reset PATH. This change adds an
additional layer as part of the shell integration scripts to increase the
chances that `ghostty` is available in your shell.

This is supported for bash, zsh, fish, and elvish.

### Mouse Scroll Multiplier for Precision Scrolling Devices

PR: GH-8927

The `mouse-scroll-multiplier` configuration now supports precision
scrolling devices like Apple trackpads. You can now independently control
multipliers for both discrete (mouse wheel) and precision (trackpad)
scrolling, making navigation through large scrollback buffers smoother
and more predictable across different input devices.

Examples:

```
# Apply the same multiplier to both precision and discrete
mouse-scroll-multiplier = 3

# Apply different multipliers (order doesn't matter)
mouse-scroll-multiplier = precision:0.1,discrete:3

# Apply only to precision, use default for discrete
mouse-scroll-multiplier = precision:2
```

The default precision multiplier is `0.1` while the default discrete
multiplier remains `1`.

### Changes for Package Maintainers

- Ghostty now limits builds to 32 cores on Linux to workaround a known
  memory corruption bug in Zig, allowing Ghostty to be reliably built on
  machines with more than 32 cores. This bug has been resolved in Zig but
  won't be backported to the 0.14.x series that Ghostty 1.2.x relies on.

## Roadmap

We believe there will likely be a 1.2.2 release at some point to continue to
address minor issues introduced by the changes in 1.2.0 and 1.2.1. A possible
1.2.2 release is probably going to be a mid-cycle release (months away) rather
than a quick follow-up.

As it stands, the 1.2.x series has been very stable and we don't feel a rush to
release any more bugfix releases. We've heard very positive feedback about the
release and we're happy to see people enjoying the new features.

See the roadmap from the [1.2.0 release notes](/docs/install/release-notes/1-2-0#roadmap)
for bigger picture plans.
