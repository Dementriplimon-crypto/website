  Release notes for Ghostty 1.2.2, released on October 8, 2025.
---

Ghostty 1.2.2 is a hotfix to fix a critical regression from 1.2.1
where we accidentally forgot to backport a memory leak fix. As a result,
Ghostty 1.2.1 has a significant memory leak under certain scenarios that
can cause runaway memory growth. This issue affects all platforms.

We've also included a very small fix for macOS font rendering that would
cause very small (one pixel or half pixel) offsets for some glyphs that could
result in blurriness.

This was released very shortly after 1.2.1, please see the
[1.2.1 release notes](/docs/install/release-notes/1-2-1).
