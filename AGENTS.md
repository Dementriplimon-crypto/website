# Ghostty Website

## Basics

- Verify all changes with `npm run build`
- Lint all code with `npm run lint` and fix all issues including warnings
- The site should be fully static, no server-side rendering, functions, etc.

## Code Style

- All functions and top-level constants should be documented with comments
